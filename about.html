        <div>Hi, my name is Alfred.</div>

        <div>I started coding in 2015 because I felt like I needed a career change. I had only took an introduction to C++ class all the way back in 2006 during my freshman year of college. I had fun in the class solving the problems in code and making cool projects like a Sudoku generator. So when I wanted a career change, this is what made me decide to become a developer.</div>

        <div>When I'm not coding, I spend my time paddling with my dragon boat team. I began paddling with my dragon boat team in 2007 and it's currently my 10th year paddling.</div>

        <div>It's been a long time, but this was the sport that got me being active. I started running long distances to see how much I can push myself. Long distance running has helped me build up the discipline to continue training even on days that I didn't want to. The best part was also trying to be better than I was before and the best feeling is when you break your own PR.</div>

        <div>Another thing I started doing was weight lifting at the gym. After many years of just doing dragon boat for fun, one of the coaches wanted to take the team to the next level so I followed his advice and started lifting. As with running, the best part is always pushing hard to seeing yourself break your PR. Because of this training, our team has made it Australia in 2016 for the Dragon Boat Club Crew World Championships. This is definitely one of the best experiences I had competing against other teams from around the world.</div>

        <div>In addition to paddling for my team, I also coach a high school team. Originally I wanted to become a math teacher because I enjoyed working with kids. After going through the credential program, I found that teaching wasn't for me. but when the opportunity to work with kids came up, I took it. It definitely has it challenges, but it's always fun being around kids since I'm still a kid at heart.</div>

        <div>Aside from being active, I enjoy playing video games and reading comic books. I grew up playing video games which is another reason I wanted to learn how to code. In addition, I love listening to podcasts. Planet Money and Stuff You Should Know are two of my favorite podcasts at the moment. I just enjoy learning how things work in the world.</div>
