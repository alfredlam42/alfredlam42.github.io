        It's it now two weeks into the DBC program and this was a great week. We learned basic HTML as well as CSS to help style the HTML. I had already learn some HTML back in 2000 when internet was only on the 56k modem. Everything was slow and there wasn't anything to do on the internet. I was still young, still in middle school. Having internet and nothing to do on it, my brother decided to create a website and I followed suit.
      </p>
      <p>
        During that time, I spent so much time trying to create a awesome website dedicated to my favorite game, Final Fantasy VII. I learned the very basics by reading articles about HTML, which is almost everything I learned this week. There were a few new things I learned this week including CSS, which made the code of the HTML a lot easier to read by reducing the styling codes in the HTML.
      </p>
        The use of CSS helped tremendously with designing my current website. I wished I had knew about it back in 2000 because I would have been able to make a better website.
      <p>
        One thing that helped me was the margin, border, and padding. It helped with moving the boxes on the website as well as changing their size.

        The image above shows what is the margin, border, and padding. But it isn't that easy to dicipher what it means so I'll explain what each of them are. But these three terms pretty much mean what they mean in everyday terms.
      </p>
      <p>
        First, imagine a blank piece of paper. Now place a rectangle on the paper (not draw a rectangle). In in that rectangle, put something in there. Anything you want.
      </p>
      <p>
        <h5>Margins</h5>
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm sure most of you know what margins are. You've written papers for college and the professor specifies that the margins of the paper is one inch, meaning that the words are one inch from the edge of the paper. It is exactly the same thing when working with CSS. Go go backk to the blank paper. The margin is the distance from the edge of the paper to the rectangle. With CSS, the margin in the code doesn't control the margin of the web site, you're controlling how far the rectangle is from the edge of the paper. For example:
      </p>
      <p>
        margin: 10px;
      </p>
      <p>
        This moves the box/content at least 10 pixels away from the edge.
      </p>
      <p>
        <h5>Border</h5>
      </p>
      <p>
        The border is fairly easy to explain. It's just the rectangle and it surrounds the item. That's all it does. The code for the border affects the border in many different way. The big one is that it adjusts the thickness of the border. For example:
      </p>
      <p>
        border: dashed red 2px;
      </p>
      <p>
        creates a red 2 pixel thick dashed border. Simple as that. In relations to the margin, the distance is from the edge to the outside of the border, not the inside.
      </p>
      <p>
        <h5>Padding</h5>
      </p>
      <p>
        The padding is very similar to the margin. As mentioned earlier, the margin is the distance from the edge of the paper to the rectangle. The padding is the distance from the rectangle to the item. For example:
      </p>
      <p>
        padding: 5px;
      </p>
      <p>
        make it so that the item in the rectangle is 5 pixels away from all the sides.
      </p>
      <p>
        I hope that explains the difference between these three things by imagining thing on a blank piece of paper.
