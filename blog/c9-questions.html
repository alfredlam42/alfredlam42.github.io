    <h1>Asking Good Questions</h1>
    <h2></h2>
    <h4>August 16, 2015</h4>
    <section>
    <p>
      When you're trying to get help from someone, it is important that you're asking a good question. Here are some things to consider when you're asking questions. These tips can help you if you're asking someone in person or if you're asking on a forum. So sections might not apply if you're asking in person.
    </p>
    <p>
      <h5>Research</h5>
    </p>
    <p>
      Google your question first. You're probably not the first person to have this type of problem so the answer might be out there already. Even though other people might be more helpful, this is something you should create a habit out of in case there isn't someone around to answer your questions. And if you find a question that has a similar problem, but doesn't quite help you solve it, save the link so when you ask about it, point out how your problem is different than this.
    </p>
    <p>
      <h5>Title</h5>
    </p>
    <p>
      Obvious why this doesn't apply when you're asking someone. On message forums, the titles are the only thing someone sees when they're scrolling through so it's important to make it so they'll open your message. So something titled "Help!" might not garner a lot of clicks because everyone on that forum needs help. The title should be descriptive and summarize the problem that you're experiencing. For example:
    </p>
    <p>
      Bad: Output Error
      <br> This does summarize your problem, but it's not very descriptive
    </p>
    <p>
      Good: Output giving me undefined when it should return integer
      <br> Not only does it summarize you're problem, it's also describes the problem you're having.
    </p>
    <p>
      And if that forum isn't specific to what language you're working with, add that in the title as well. If it has "Ruby", people who know Ruby will have a higher chance of reading your message.
    </p>
    <p>
      <h5>Message</h5>
    </p>
    <p>
      When writing the message, the first few lines are important too. If it is too confusing or it looks like it'll take a while to get to the point of the question, people might just stop and move on. For the first paragraph, write a summary of the problem and describe what the code should do and what it is actually doing. Don't write what you think is wrong because it's only what you think. It's not a fact that will help solve the problem.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now in the second paragraph, be more descriptive of the problem. It's helpful for other people to know what you did leading up to the error.
    </p>
    <p>
      And finally, if it is neccesary, only include the snippet of the code for others to look at. There's no point in including all the code for that specific program. If someone sees a big wall of text when they see the messsage, they might leave. I'm one of those people who sees that if the message is too long, I'll just ignore it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <h5>Proof-reading</h5>
    </p>
    <p>
      Now that you're done writing your questions, re-read it. First thing to do is making sure your grammar is fine because it might cause confusion. And no one wants to read something that is hard to understand due to grammar. Second, make sure the questions you're asking has all the information needed to solve the problem. If you're missing anything, now is the time to add it in. They don't have all the information that you have so it's important that you don't miss anything. Now is also a good time to check the format of the questions, especially if you pasted your code. Make sure when you're looking at the code, it's easy to read. And lastly, check the title of your message. Is it still a good title for this question? 
    </p>
    <p>
      <h5>Responding</h5>
    </p>
    <p>
      After someone responds to you and you follow their advice, respond to them. Let them know that you followed their advice and if it worked or not. If it didn't, repeat the process and describe the problem to them of what you did and what error showed up (if it is different). If it works, let the person know and thank them. This also lets other people know the problem has been solved so they don't waste their time trying to help you.
