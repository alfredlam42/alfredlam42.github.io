      I have a friend who has taken DBC and another friend who has taken a different bootcamp. Both of them said that you get what you put into it. And that is my mindset coming into this program. I want to be great at what I do so I will dedicate a good amount of time into this program. Since it's only the first week, I'm still trying to figure what schedule works nicely since I have a few things I have on my plate like a job, sports activities (practice and training), as well as coaching duties.

      But what I like about DBC is the principle of their teaching method. As mentioned by Shereef, we have been conditioned to just sit, listen, and get answers correct to pass the class when we attended school. And like any kid, I was afraid of asking the teacher for help because I didn't want them thinking I was dumb. So I always asked my friend because I know we all are learning it for the first time. I wouldn't feel as dumb asking them for help. But the DBC culture embraces that we don't know everything. When they say it, I feel like I can always ask the teachers for help if I needed it (and also now that I have grown up, I don't care if they think I'm stupid).

      I tend to learn better when I get hands on with the problem. Lectures are great depending on the subject, but for something like coding, it is better to do than to listen and hope to retain all that information. So I think having those core challenges everyday of the in class instruction sounds like something I would enjoy so I'm excited for that. But the core challenges also make me nervous since I'm not sure of how much I know when it starts. The entire program made me nervous. I need to learn everything in 9 weeks which will fly by very fast. I'm confident in my ability to learn new things, but not know what it actually is that I will be doing makes me nervous.
