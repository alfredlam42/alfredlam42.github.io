      When you run a program on a computer, tablet, or your phone, a lot of information gets processed for the program to work correctly. Like everything on your computer, all the information needs a place to be stored. The information created from running a program doesn't need to be saved permanently because the program can always recreate the information when you run the program. Imagine that it is saved permanently on your computer every time you run it. It would consume your hard drive with useless information and you'll run out of space unless you delete it yourself. So instead of saving it onto you computer's hard drive, the information created by the program is stored in the computer's memory.

      The computer's memory, called RAM (Random Access Memory), is where programs store the information they created when you run the program. Everything is stored in the RAM is temporary information and disappears when the program closes or when the computer turns off. So nothing is stored in there until the computer is turned on.

      For example, let's say we have a program that has a variable x in a function somewhere in the code. Just because there is an x doesn't mean it'll take up space in the RAM. Only if that function gets used is when the variable will take up space. The amount of RAM being used is dependant on how the program is coded. Let's say in the same function that x is in, there is also a variable y. If you declare a variable y, it will take up space. But if you never do anything with it besides giving it a piece of infomation, then y is a useless variable that is taking up space. So a well coded program won't have any useless variables to save RAM.

      So imagine an empty parking lot. The more programs that are being runned, the more spots in the parking lot gets filled. Like in a real parking lot, as the spaces fill up, it'll take longer to find an available space which is why you might notice a program running slower when you are running many programs at once. And it'll take just a long to find information that is already stored in the RAM. Once you close a program, all the information related to it will be deleted from the computer's memory and it'll free up space for other programs to use.

      As a coder, it is important to consider how much memory your program will use. Code should be able to do everything efficiently taking up as little memory as possible. The more it uses, the longer it'll take for the program to execute. Right now we are writing small programs so it'll only take milliseconds longer. But for bigger programs, it might add seconds and it'll take up a lot of memory. Most people don't just do one thing at a time on their computer. They have many different programs openned at once. If your program takes a lot of memory, it'll slow down everything they are doing.
