    <h1>Arrays and Hashes - When Do I Use These</h1>

        It's the third week at DBC and this week was a lot easier. Started an introduction to Ruby, which was an easy concept to understand due to the fact that I have taken an introductory C++ class in college back in 2006. It's a long time ago, but everything I learned came back to me while learning about Ruby. So many similarities and so many differences as well.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the concepts we learned was about arrays. It's not even a word you hear every day like padding, border, or the other terms used in CSS. So I'm here to explain what it is.
      </p>
      <p>
        To begin, when writing in Ruby or any other language, information is usually stored in a variable and these variables are named however you want them. Usually it's something that tells what information is stored in the variable. For example you might call a variable "name" because it stores names. The most important thing is that each variable can only store one piece of information. So the names Alfred and Ben cannot be stored in the variable "name". You would have to create another variable "name2" or however you want to name them.
      </p>
      <p>
        But let's say you have a lists of names. You wouldn't want to create variables "name1", "name2", "name3" and so forth. It's just so much work to type. In addition, what if you want to add more names to that list later? The program has no way of knowing how many more variables you'll need. This is where arrays come in. An array is just a variable that stores different arguments in its many slots. Just imagine a row with infinitely many columns. Each column is stored with a different argument. Now you're wondering how we get each element if they are stored in a different space. But first, let's look at how we assign the elements to each slot.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are two ways to assign an element to an array. Here is the first way:
          <script src="https://gist.github.com/alfredlam42/b2d64170e5d661aed43f.js"></script>
        First, note that I'm not that creative with naming variables. I just called it "array", but you can call it whatever you want. As you can see, each column of the array is being filled with a separate string.
      </p>
      <p>
        A second way to assign elements to an array is this:
          <script src="https://gist.github.com/alfredlam42/0b68ad184f788ab13f74.js"></script>
        By assigning the elements to each column using this method, it's easy to see how you can get each element you have stored in each column. Notice that to get the element in the first column, you would being with 0, not 1. Keep that in mind when working with arrays. So if you want the third element, you would actually be using a 2 to get it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Arrays seems easy enough right? But what if you have the office's lunch order? Alfred wants a roast beef sandwich, Ben wants a turkey sandwich, Connor wants pastrami sandwich, and so forth. If you use an array, you would need one array for the names and another array for the order. But there is a better way with hashes. Hashes are arrays, but with a minor difference. With arrays, numbers are assigned for each column as seen with [0] or [2]. But with hashes, you can assign whatever you want in between each square bracket [].
      </p>
      <p>
        Here's an example:
          <script src="https://gist.github.com/alfredlam42/c0c0b0919facc74b120c.js"></script>
        Notice how it is similar to assigning arrays with the second method. The only difference is that you're using the curly brackets {} instead of the square brackets [].
      </p>
      <p>
        With hashes, it's a lot simpler to get the information you need compared to arrays. With an array, you can think to yourself "What did Ben order?" and you might not be sure if you put his order in the 0th slot or the 3rd slot of the array so you don't know where to get the information. But with hashes, you can get it from the "Ben" slot with no problem.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is a way to do it with arrays, where you have an array within an array. Kind of confusing and might be a bit harder to grasp that concept so let's just stick with hashes for now. We can go into the array within an array another time.
