    <h1>Values</h1>

      Values are an important aspect of a person's life. What a person values can show you who they are and what they will do and what they won't do. For me, the most important values are: trust, loyalty, friendship, discipline, hard work, honesty, and self knowledge.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the value that I think is the most important to me is honesty. For me, if you're honest, life is just easier and that is the life that I want. Too many lies make it hard because you have to keep track of every lie if you want to have your friend's trust. And having trust based on lies isn't the best thing to have to begin with. But just because I value honesty doesn't mean I'll go around telling everyone what is on my mind. If you ask me for advice or an opinion, I will never hesitate to tell you what I think. You won't hear me sugar coating anything.

      The last time someone ask me for my opinion if they will be able to make it to the A boat for our team. Like I said before, I told her what I thought. I didn't tell her she has a good chance so she'll feel good about herself. I told her exactly what I thought because what's the point of lying? Will hearing that she will be able to make it to the A boat allow her to suddenly get better and stronger? No. But I also didn't tell her it was impossible. If she works at it consistently starting now, she might be able to make it by the end of the season, but beginning of next season would be a better chance. A few months later, she asked what I thought of her progress. Still I told her the truth because she wasn't consistent with her workouts so for this season, it would be impossible. I like to keep things realistic. Telling her something I don't believe isn't true isn't going to help anyone. She'll be more crushed when the results come out.

      As mentioned before, I don't usually feel any outside pressure from influences which I think I can attribute to self knowledge. I do a lot of self reflection because it's important to understand who you are. You know your weaknesses, things you can improve on, things you're great at, and many other things about yourself. Especially if there are any negative influences, it's good to know your weaknesses. But doing that you can figure out how to overcome it and get better at those things. Nothing is set in stone because you can always change. Even though you know your weaknesses, it's also important to know that it'll take time to over come them. Just because you know it doesn't mean you can fix yourself right away. So just because something bad happens again, doesn't mean you're weak. It just means you still need more time.

      That's all I can say about stereotype threat. There will always be fear of something, but it's how you deal with it that define what kind of person you are.
