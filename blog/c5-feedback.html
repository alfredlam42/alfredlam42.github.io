    <h1>Peer Pairing - Working Together and Getting Feedback</h1>

        One of the things that we do at DBC is pairing with our peers. Depending at where you work, you will most likely be working with someone else so this is just part of working in a real work environment. This is something that I didn't do when I took an introductory C++ course in college. We always worked on everything by ourselves. For me since it wasn't mandatory, I always worked by myself.
      </p>
      <p>
        But there are many benefits of working together with your peers. If you don't particularly understand a topic or what needs to be done for a challenge, there is someone who can help you and explain to you what needs to be done. Sure, you can definitely ask someone else about this, but in phase 0, I feel that it is better to ask someone and have them explain it to you in real time compared to posting in the group and waiting for a response. Another benefit is that you can learn how to solve a problem in a different way. I have a way of how I want to solve my the problem, but it's always good to see a different way. It'll just make you a better coder in the future. There are so many different methods avaialble to use, so if you don't see it another person's way, you might not find more usefuly methods that you can use for yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
        For me a lot of these things I have a fairly good concept of how to solve the problem. It's just coding and finding Ruby methods to help me that might take some time. I always like to drive instead of navigate because I want to see how my partner solves the challenge. But I do switch because they want to see how I would solve the challenges too. So I like to drive first and then build on top of what my partner has laid down for the foundation of the code. This way, I have to think of a different way than my own solution that I had planned out. All the challenges I could do by myself, but this benefit makes pairing worth it.

      <p>
        After our pairing session, we always leave feedback for the other person on what went great and what they can improve on. This is so we can improve on how to be a better partner the next time we pair with someone else. I personally loves getting feedback. As an athelete, it's something that I look forward to because I always want to get better and do better. No matter what you do, it's always important to have feedback.
      </p>
      <p>
        After reading the feedback I had received, I've already done some of the things before I read it. It's just getting used to the pairing and doing it more often which is why some of my earlier pairings I might have seem lost and not know what to do with my partner. Depending on if I have time after the pairing, I do look back and think about what went well and what didn't. If I can do anything for myself to get better. I'm not just waiting for feedback from my partner, but I'm also doing self reflection to get better.
      </p>
      <p>
        Giving feedback is definitely something I need to improve on. I'm a very blunt person. My friends know that so whatever I say they don't take it as though I'm being mean. That's one reason when I write my feedback, it takes a lot more time because I need to pick my words carefully. With written feedback, you don't know the tone of how the person is speaking besides their word choices. No one wants to read feedback that makes them feel horrible so they usually ignore that feedback. I know I wouldn't want to read something like that and if I did, I don't want to think about it so the feedback is ignored. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Another thing about giving feedback for me is that sometimes things just seem normal and there wasn't anything that I thought needed improvement or was especially great. Those are the hardest ones to write because there really isn't anything to write about. Who wants to read a feedback that says "Great job!"? Some things that people think that I need improvement on, I might not see that about my partner. For example, I need to say what I'm doing otherwise I might seem like I'm just sitting there and not doing anything. If my partner doesn't say anything, I'm going to assume they are doing something that is contributing to the challenge. I will check in with them because I'm probably also focusing on doing something myself. I always believe people will be doing what they need to do. But others might see it differently.
