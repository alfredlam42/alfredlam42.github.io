    <h1>Version Control - Git and Github</h1>

        It's nearing the end of my first week here doing Phase 0 at DBC and it was a great feeling. Like the first week of any class, we just started learning the very basics of being a developers. Nothing related to coding at th moment, but things like setting up the computer, using important developer tools, and such.

        One thing that I think is super important is that there is a thing called version control on Github. The gist of it is that everytime you save a file and send it to the server, it doesn't overwrite the previous file. It saves it as a separate file (still has the same name). If you find out later that the new code you wrote completely crashes the program, you might want to open the previous version of the file before any of the new code was added. This makes sure that you don't accidentally delete more than you intended. This is only one example of why version control is important. But I believe a majority of why version control is important is because someone screwed up something and we need to go back.
      </p>

        But how do we keep track of all the different versions? Git helps us with that. Like I mentioned before, it doesn't overwrite any files, it saves the file separately everytime you save and commit your changes. So even though you have just edited the file and saved the updates on your local text editor, if you don't commit your changes on git, it doesn't actually save that version. If you accidentally remove those changes, you can't go back to a previous version. So it is important to commit those changes when you have saved your file on that text editor. Everytime you commit a file, there should be a code and a message of what was changed. By looking at the message, you know what was updated from the previous versions. And by using the code from the previous commits, that's how git distinguishes which version you want to go back to.
      </p>
      <p>
        Git sounds great and all, but it is just a program on your computer so it saves everything on your computer. If your hard drive were to crash, you would lose everything. One place where people store their code online is Github. But that website isn't just a file hosting website. It's a community where open source code is available for people to use (pending licenses) or collaborate on a project together. Even though everyone might be working on one project, the files aren't just saved automatically to the project. One a file has been updated commited on git, it is then pushed into the repository for this project on Github. The main project manager reviews up upates (the changes are highlighted for easy reviewing) and then decides to accept those changes or not and save onto the repository.

        Well, that is what I have learned about version contorl this first week at DBC. Please correct me if I did make any mistakes about version control. I could be wrong and this is how I interpreted the information when I read it.
