        One big problem in tech is the implementation of security into the products provided by tech companies. As more and more start ups create new apps, there are many chances for hackers and thieves to steal private information.

        One story that came to my mind was the story about Venmo and how some guy got a lot of money stolen from his account. His notifications has been disabled and his password has been changed. So he didn't know his password got changed or money was taken out from his account. Definitely a horrible incident. There were many problems at Venmo that led to this incident happening. It's when a small company starts getting very popular that their staff cannot support the growth of users, which probably led to this.

        For tech companies, you can only think of so many different problems that could come up when creating an app or any kind of service. But there are so many people out there who comb through the loop holes and take advantage of it for their gains so it's important for tech companies to implement proven methods that can combat cyber security threats.

        An new company should implement current working security methods. There is no need to re-invent the wheel when you first start. Build on top of it once the current methods work so at least you have something in place to protect everyone's personal information. Two factor authentication has work very well. As well as sending e-mails to people when the password has been changed or the e-mail has been changed. Basically always send an e-mail when any type of information has been change is a good idea.

        Aside from just the normal, looking through the code, for loop holes, any new company, tech or not, need to educate their employees about social engineering. It's when people do things in a way that gets them the results they wanted. You might think talking on the phone with someone, you cannot be tricked into giving them private information, but it happens all the time. It's important for employees to follow identification verification procedures to make sure they are who they say they are. Don't just believe them without any evidence.

        It's not just over the phone either that people can hack into computer systems. If you haven't read about this before, the U.S. dropped a USB stick near the Iran nuclear plant. One of the workers their picked up the USB stick and plugged it into the plant's computer, which is connected to the network. And now the U.S. has access to the plant's control and information. But reports cannot confirm if this actually happened.

        With tech apps growing and popularity rising, tech companies are a place for hackers to get a whole bunch of information. It's not just the security with the programs tech companies create, it's also education to the staff that will help prevent security breaches
