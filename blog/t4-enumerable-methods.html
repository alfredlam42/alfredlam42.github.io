    <h1>Mapping</h1>

      One usefuly method in Ruby that I have used this week was #map for arrays and hashes. At first it seems like it works like the method #each, and it does, but there is one big difference. Both of these run through the elements, but the key difference is in what happens to the array/hash. #each runs the block of code for each element, but it returns the original object. For example:
        <script src="https://gist.github.com/alfredlam42/155bbf8e22a560716b22.js"></script>
      In this example, I made i = i + 1 and the print is 2, 3, and 4 as expected. But the object the gets returned is the original array. So no matter what you do with the block, it will always return the original.
    </p>
    <p>
      #map is different than #each in that it creates a new array using information from the original array and returns the new array. Example:
        <script src="https://gist.github.com/alfredlam42/d048ee1a1a63a70ffdae.js"></script>
      Notice that the new modified array is returned unlike #each. So depending on what you want to do with you're code, understand the difference and use what fits best.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here's one more thing to note about #map. I ran into this problem this week.
        <script src="https://gist.github.com/alfredlam42/7bc09fd294df82482e40.js"></script>
      Notice that the array returned in [nil, nil, nil]. Like writing methods, the object that gets returned in the last line of code that gets evaluated. #puts was the last line and no matter what it prints onto the screen, it will always return nil. So it would be a good idea to explicitly return and object if you plan to do more things before the end of the code.
