    <h1>Stereotype Threat</h1>
    <h2>How It Affects Performance</h2>

        Stereotype threat is something I've never heard of before, but it is something that can affect every one. To start off, stereotype is a generalization about a group of people. It can be positive or negative, but it started because someone observed a certain behavior and just made a generalization. So stereotype threat is when someone feels they are going to confirm negative stereo types about their group. That group could be race, gender, economical standing, etc. There are so many different groups that people identify with.

        One common example of stereotype threat is that women are bad at math and science. If a women is not doing well in their math or science class, they might think they are going to confirm that negative stereotype. And because they are worrying about that, their concentration and focus might not be entirely on their work and in turn they don't do well in that class.

        How strongly stereotype threat affects a person depends on how much interest or passion they have in what they are doing. Going back to the previous example about women and math, if there is someone who doesn't care about their math grade, they won't feel pressure that they are going to be confirming that negative stereotype. Their performance won't be affect by stereotype threat. If someone is very passionate about it, then they will feel enormous pressure from stereotype threat and that will affect their performance even more.

        I can't really recall a time when I've been impacted by stereotype threat because I don't really care too much if I fit into a certain category or not. But a lot of the stereotypes I can think of are related to academics and sports. But I think the impact of stereotype threat is similar to the feeling you get when you're trying not to fail. With so much pressure that you have to succeed, I can relate to that. You try not to think about it, but it will always be somewhere in your mind. When you're thinking about so you can achieve success, the thought of failure pops up and takes time away from you working on succeeding.

        The only advice I can give to people to is learn to accept failure if you know you have done everything you can and just do better next time. Don't accept defeat because now you know what you need to do to get better. I think it's a good mindset that people should try to develop. And work on improving discipline since discipline is what gets you to do what you need to do even when you don't have the inspiration or motivation.

        The environment is also a huge factor that contributes to stereotype threat. It might be something as innocent as having a certain type of music play in the background of the room. You might think anything of it, but if it only plays classical music, people might feel this place is more for sophiticated people. So it's not always just plain old stereotype that can affect the impact of stereotype threat. That doesn't mean you shouldn't put up pictures of things you like or your favorite pictures. It's something everyone does so it can't really be helped. But I think it's good to just put up a bit more diverse things in the environment so it doesn't feel like it caters to just one group.
