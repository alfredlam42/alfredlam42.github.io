    <h1>Abstract Sequential</h1>
    <h2></h2>

      <p>
        A person with an abstract thinking style uses their intuition and imagination to understand, believe, and come up with ideas that are not physically there. With a sequential thinking style, a person organizes their thoughts in a step-by-step fashion. Every step is well thought out and has a reason.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm an abstract sequential thinker and I believe it describes me quite well. I was a math major which covers both the abstract and sequential part. In upper division math courses, we just discuss the theoretical side. There reallying isn't much adding and subtracting like you would see in the average math classes. We would also have to prove a lot of these theories and rules which is the sequential part of this. Everything is based on logic and is worked out by solving one thing at a time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here's a list of the things related to the abstract sequential thinker:
      </p>

        <h3>This learner likes:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>his/her point to be heard</li>
          <li>analyzing situations before making a decision or acting</li>
          <li>applying logic in solving or finding solutions to problems</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>They learn best when:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>they have access to experts or references</li>
          <li>placed in stimulating environments</li>
          <li>able to work alone</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>What's hard for them:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>being forced to work with those of differing views</li>
          <li>too little time to deal with a subject thoroughly</li>
          <li>repeating the same tasks over and over</li>
          <li>lots of specific rules and regulations</li>
          <li>"sentimental" thinking</li>
          <li>expressing their emotions</li>
          <li>being diplomatic when convincing others</li>
          <li>Not monopolizing a conversation</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the reasons why I enjoy programming is because it fits into my thinking style. Analyzing problems and using logic to solve them. Coding is like a puzzle. You have everything you need to know (or Google if you don't remember) and you're trying to solve the problem. Everything needs to be worked out step by step until the puzzle is solved. Because computers are dumb and only do what they are told, every code that is typed in needs to make logical sense. And each of these puzzles are a challenge which I look forward to.
      </p>
      <p>
        Coding, like math, is an abstract concept. I can learn and grasps the concept easily through reading or being taught by someone. But the reading or the teacher needs to make the subject interesting. It's like picking a professor in college. Two professors are teaching the same things, but the ones that I learn best from are the ones who are very interested and enthusiatic about what they are teaching. The writing style of the book needs to have more personality of the author, not a robot. And I think the biggest thing that helps me with my learning is working alone where I can do a lot of trial and error. I do get stuck at points, but that is when I know I need to ask for help.
      </p>
      <p>
        I think DBC has provided me a with a good environment where I can take advantage of my thinking style to do my best. With phase 0, there is a lot of work you do alone, which is perfect for me. But they also have peer pairing, which helps because I know it is important for me to see how other people think. Maybe they can write code that is more succinct compared to mine. So far I think DBC has done a very good job in creating a program where it's helpful for my developement.
      </p>
      <p>
        Reflecting on what I've done so far in DBC, the only struggle that I had was working with CSS. It was very reassuring that everyone is having problems with it and it was addressed by the instructors. I don't think I was struggling because of my thinking style. During that week, I was away in Vancouver, BC, Canada for a dragon boat competition and there wasn't much time for me to do a lot of trial and errors with the code and complete the assignment on time. I am definitely working on it so that I do get a better understanding of the position in CSS, so it's only a matter of time that I understand it completely.
      </p>

        One thing that also affects how people learn is their mindset. Most people fall in two categories: growth or fixed. People with a growth mindset believe that they can improve their intelligence as they take on new experiences. While fixed mindset people believes that you are born with a limit to your intelligence and it cannot grow. Obviously you can tell the people with the growth mindset are the ones who usually succeed. Because people with fixed mindsets believe if they don't understand something now, they will never understand it. And people with growth mindsets are the opposite. Even though they might not understand it now, they believe they will eventually understand it.
      </p>
      <p>
        With a growth mindset, I usually go into challenges expecting to fail the first time instead of not doing the challenge because you know you will fail. I might not know everything at the moment, I can forget things, and I will ask for help. There are people who are better than you and I always use that to my advantage. If I don't undrstand something (usually after working on it for a while) I would ask for help. Then I like to repeat what I heard to make sure I understand it properly. If I repeat something and it's wrong, it's better to fix it right then and there instead of find out later.
      </p>
      <p>
        I do believe the growth mindset is the best thing to have. I even tell the kids that I coach that it's okay that they are getting B's and C's in class ask long as they tried because they will eventually get it. It might not be until the school year is over (which doesn't help since colleges are looking at grades), but they will eventually get it.
