      I redesigned my website today. If you're been here since the beginning, the background color and everything was different. The color scheme was from Finn from Adventure Time. I messed around with the colors a bit, but after thinking that this will become my professional blog, I decided to go with something simple. White background, which is what most websites use. I added a border around the main body, but that color is the darker shade of blue from the original design. I didn't want everything to disappear.

      Another thing I was thinking to myself is that what should go on the home page. There really wasn't anything there and I can't think of anything that will continually be updated there so there wasn't really any point to having a home page. I decided that I'll put the about me as my home page. So I took out the about me link at the top and replaced it with the "Contact Me" link. I think this was a better choice. I think the biggest challenge for this section was having the image at the right size. On a computer, it looks fine and would fit. I like to make sure my website also looks good on a phone so I checked it on my phone as well. The picture was definitely bigger than the desginated space. Did some research to find out what the best thing to do was and now it resizes itself on a phone (or a smaller screen).

      One thing that I wanted to add was jQuery code since I just learned some of the basics from doing this week's challenge. It's not that complicated right now since I didn't really want the website to be very fancy. It just has to do with the mouse over and the mouse leave function. Even then, I only did something very simple.

      I'm not that creative so it took me a while to finalize my decision. I was looking at other websites that I visited to see what they did. What company websites looked like. And the designs that I liked the best were very simple. You don't need the website to look all fancy for it to be considered professional. Sometimes it might be too much for people to navigate. It's also easier to code as well if it's simple. Win win on both parts.
