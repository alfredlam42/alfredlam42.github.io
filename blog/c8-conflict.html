      I usually try to avoid conflict. If there is a way to avoid it, I'll take that route. Why go through something troublesome when it doesn't need to happen in the first place? But onc ein a while you do something by accident and that will lead to some kind of conflict. This is one of those cases.

      I was talking to one of my friends through messages and she sends me a picture of her and the book she was reading while waiting for her flight at the airport. first thing I notice is that the title of the books are mirrored (backwards) and I pointed that out to her with some joke. Second thing I notice, she had bags under her eyes and I pointed that out to her and she was upset. First off, I was shocked she was actually offended by this comment. I didn't think it was that big of a deal and I was just pointing something out in her picture. Then she asked for an apology and I felt kind of annoyed that I had to deal with this. I usually don't apologize unless I did something wrong. Looking ahead, I decided it would be best to just apologize instead of dragging it out because like I mentioned, I like to avoid any type of conflict if possible. Even though I didn't feel like I did anything wrong, I did it because it'll make her feel better that I did it.

      If I could go back, I definitely won't do it again. I just thought it would be something funny to point out, but if knew this would happen, it's not worth the trouble. But it's hard to know how someone will react to everything you do or say to them. People could experience the same thing differently so it's justifiable that they could see it is a negative experience while you might see it as a positive one. It's not possible to account for everything because that's just how different everyone is.
